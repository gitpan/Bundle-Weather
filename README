This bundle contains a collection of modules for processing weather products
(forecasts, observations, etc.).

The current version only performs the only basic processing of weather
products. Future versions may include modules for handling and routing
EMWIN (Emergency Managers Weather Information Network) streams. Or even
parsing the information into HTML or XML documents. 

Consider this "beta" code. Some of the modules still lack decent PODs
or even some obvious "features".

Below is a simple program which will fetch the latest state forecast from
the NWS "Interactive Weather Information Network" server and print it out.
(The default zone and URL will have to be changed to match your location,
of course.) 

    require Weather::Product::NWS;

    $zone = shift || 'NYZ079';
    $file = 'ftp://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/data/text/FPUS61/KOKX.TXT';

    $forecast = new Weather::Product::NWS($file);

    print $forecast->text($zone), "\n";

Required Modules:

        Carp
        FileHandle
        LWP::UserAgent
        Time::Local
